  <h2 style="color:green">The 4 Noble Truths</h2>
  <p>Dukkha: all life is suffering, pain, and misery.
  </p>
  <p>Tanha: this suffering has a cause.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nirodha: the termination of selfish craving can be achieved.
  </p>
  <p>
    Magga: the way to overcome this misery is through the Eightfold Path.

    <li>Who is Buddha?</li>
    <p>
      this is a test
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the same time Confucius was teaching Chinese people how to lead the
      good life, a prince called Siddhartha Gautama, or Gotama, became famous
      for his holiness and love of all creatures. He was called the Enlightened
      One (Buddha) a title used by many groups in ancient India but associated
      now mostly with Gautama. Many persons believed in the teachings of Buddha
      while he lived. After his death, shrines called stupas were built in his
      honor, and his religion spread through a great part of Asia. By the early
      21st century some 380 million people professed the Buddhist faith.
    </p>
    <li>Why are we still talking about him 2500 years later?</li>
    <p>
      Buddha is still talked about today because lots of people in Asia and more
       importantly people with power believed in what he preached and when
       Buddha died they kept the faith going with the help of the order of monks
       he created.
    </p>
    <li>How many people are Buddhist? Where do they primarily live?</li>
    <p>
      Approximately 7.5% of people in the world are Buddhists. They mainly
      live in Thailand and Cambodia with those to countries having about 95%
      of all Buddhists in their boundaries.
    </p>
    <li>What are the main types of Buddhism?</li>
    <p>
     The Lower Vehicle
  	AKA the way of the elders. Hinayana is the more conservative interpreters of
    the Buddhist teachings. Another name is Theravada Buddhism (this name is
    more respectful name for way of the elders). Hinayana is still the main
    religion of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. Honor Buddha as
    a perfected master. They focus on the historical figure and stress the
    monastic life and the striving for wisdom.
   <br />
   <br />
    The Greater Vehicle
  	AKA Mahayana. Mahayana is popular in Mongolia, Tibet, China, Japan, Korea,
    Vietnam and Nepal. It accepts a number more teachings and texts, but the
    main difference between the schools is how they see the life and teaching of
    Buddha. Mahayana Buddhists emphasize the heavenly nature of the Buddha and
    stress the importance of many different Buddhas.
    <br />
    <br />
  Zen Buddhism
  Is a derivative of the Mahayana school which has far more followers then
  Theravada schools. The most popular school of Buddhism in Japan is part of
  the Mahayana tradition.
    </p>
    <li>Is it growing in popularity?</li>
    <p>
    Yes. Especially in the west with the Hipster Movement, people are trying
    new things to make there lives more enjoyable and following trends, one of
    which is become a Buddhists.
    </p>
    <li>Benefits and/or difficulties (positives/negatives) of being a Buddhist</li>
    <p>
     My opinion is that the 4 noble truths and the 8-fold noble path are
     restrictive. This does not mean they are bed, they just do not allow people
     to lean from mistakes and grow as people. The 4 noble truths and the
     8-fold noble path do create humble, kind-hearted, selfless people, but do
     not allow them to express who they really are.

     Dear Buddha,
     <br />
     I am interested in becoming a Buddha and while researching, I struggled to
     grasp the concept of Buddhist pare. How do I pray and what to?
     <br />
     From
     <br />
     Peter H
     <br />
     <br />
     <br />
    Dear Peter,
    <br />
    Buddhist pare is done through meditation. Buddhist do not believe in a
    creator god. Meditation creates a happier life and allows us to properly
    reflect on what we need to. I suggest finding a Buddhist temple and
    participating with the services to understand how meditation works better
    and gives you needed practice. Good luck in your journey to Nirvana.

    <br />
    Dear Buddha,
    <br />
    I am not a Buddhist but would like to attend a service at my local temple.
    Would this be allowed?
    <br />
    Thank you
    <br />

    Dear Georgia,
    <br />
    Most temples allow it. Though it is appropriate to call the temple ahead of
    time and inquire. The larger, more established temples often publish
    announcements in local newspapers to show the schedule of the next service. When
    attending you may participate in communal rituals, alternatively you can observe
    in silence from the back of the temple. I hope you enjoy the service when you
    attend.
    <br />
    Buddha
