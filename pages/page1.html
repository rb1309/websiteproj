  <h2 style="color:red">The Eightfold Path</h2>
  <p>
    1.	Right Knowledge is knowledge of what life is all about;
    knowledge of the Four Noble Truths is basic to any further
    growth as a Buddhist.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  Right Aspiration means a clear devotion to being on the
    Path toward Enlightenment
  </p>
  <p>
    3.	Right Speech involves both clarity of what is said
    (taking care to say just what is meant) and speaking
    kindly and without bitterness.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.	Right Behavior involves reflecting on the behavior of one,
     and the reasons for it. It also involves five basic laws
      of behavior for Buddhists: not to kill, steal, lie, drink
       intoxicants, or commit sexual offenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.	Right Livelihood involves choosing an occupation that keeps
     an individual on the Path; that is, a path that promotes life
      and well-being, rather than the accumulation of a lot of money.
  </p>
  <p>
    6.	Right Effort means training the will and curbing selfish
    passions and wants. It also means placing oneself along the
    Path toward Enlightenment.
  </p>
  <p>
    7.	Right Mindfulness implies continuing self-examination and
     awareness. The Dhammapada, a basic Buddhist text, begins:
      All we are is the result of what we have thought.
  </p>
  <p>
    8.   Right Concentration is the final goal, to be absorbed into a
    state of Nirvana
